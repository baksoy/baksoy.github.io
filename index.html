			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>I am a Turkish immigrant living in the United States for about 24 years now. I have a BS Degree in Business/Finance and a Masters degree in Information Technology.</p>
			<p>I started my career in marketing but switched to IT in the late 90's.</p>
			<p>Remember the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem" target="_blank">Y2K-Mania?</a> That's when I got in this field</p>
			<p>I started working for my current employer on a Y2K project and have been working at the same company ever since.</p>

			<h1>More About Me</h1>
			<h2 class="highlight">Do you have a pet?</h2>
			<p>I have a lovely cinnamon green cheek <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/angiesimps/greencheek-cinnamon.jpg" target="_blank">conure</a>. It's like having another kid in the house. She has quite a personality. Sometimes we feel like she's a little puppy trapped in a bird's body :) </p>
			<h2 class="highlight">What's your dream job?</h2>
			<p>I don't have one. I have more important things in life than to consider a job "a dream". Jut find what you enjoy doing and doesn't seem like a job and the rest comes easy. I am in it, a satisfied individual being in the technology field.</p>
			<p>I have always had a curious mind - since childhood. I enjoyed figuring out things. Now, I can do that by working out solutions to everyday problems by way of technology.</p>
			<h2 class="highlight">What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
			<p>I listen to Qasidas.</p>
			<p>Qasida (an Arabic word), is a form of lyric poetry sung by a group of male vocalists withou any musical instruments. An example of a well known qasida is the "Qasida Burda" by Imam al-Busiri is an ode of praise for Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).</p>
